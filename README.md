# Pomodoro-Timer-Project
It is a productivity timer. The Graphical User Interface is made by using Tkinter. The Timer will start after clicking on the start button, and go on for 25 minutes in which the user must work. Once the the timer is up the frame will pop up to the front of the user screen to tell the user to take a 5 min break(timer). This goes on for 4 rounds.
It has two buttons, one for start and other to reset the timer. 
You can see the assigned task on the screen just above the timer clock i.e if it is *work* time or if it is *break* time.
After each work session there will be a checkmark added to our gui to indicate the number of sessions the user has been working for.
After four sessions of 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break in between there will be a session for **long break**, which is of 20 minutes.
Pomodoro technique is highly effective as it helps you effectively manage your time and work on a task without distractions.
It is also beneficial as it helps you become more disciplined and think about your work.
This technique is designed to combat multitasking and improve concentration.
